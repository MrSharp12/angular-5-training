<!-- ngIf statement works like an if statment -->
<!-- typically, directives are added using an attribute selector -->
<!-- ngIf is a structural directive (designated by the *), meaning it changes the DOM -->
<!-- * is needed before ngIf, otherwise it will not work correctly -->
<!-- ngIf must return anything that is a boolean, including a method or directly make the check -->
<!-- between the quotation marks -->
<!-- note, ngIf item that is created isn't hidden -->
<!-- it's just not there, it gets added or removed -->
